                <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Local Data Processing</h3>
                <p>iCleaner is designed with a "local-first" approach. All cleaning operations, file analysis, and optimizations happen directly on your device. Your photos, videos, documents, and contacts are not uploaded to our servers during normal app operations.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Secure Vault</h3>
                <p>Files stored in the iCleaner vault are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. The encryption keys are stored securely on your device and are protected by your device's biometric authentication or PIN code. We do not have access to your vault encryption keys or the contents of your vault.</p>

                <h3>3.3 Data Transmission Security</h3>
                <p>When data must be transmitted to our servers (such as crash reports or usage analytics), we use secure HTTPS connections with TLS encryption to protect data in transit.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Cloud Backup (Optional)</h3>
                <p>If you choose to enable cloud backup for your vault (premium feature), your encrypted files are uploaded to secure cloud storage. Even in cloud storage, your files remain encrypted with keys only you possess. We cannot decrypt or access your backed-up files.</p>

                <h3>3.5 Data Retention</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data and Analytics:</strong> Retained for up to 24 months for analysis and improvement purposes</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Retained for up to 12 months to identify and fix recurring issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Retained until you delete your account</li>
